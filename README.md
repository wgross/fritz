# fritz

After stumbling upon a perl implementation of TR64 I've digged out an article from german computer magazine c't where access to the fritz box was shown by using powershell scripting. While the article gave me some insight in the soapish communication protocol TR64. I didn't like the powershell implementation. It didn't use newer powershell features (> v3.0) like 'Invoke-RestMethod'.

This repo contains my take on the implementation of TR64 with powershell. It is by far not complete and provides a set of command√∂et to read data from the fritzbox:

* Retrieve TR64 soap services and their parameter definitions (Get-TR64.., Select-Tr64.. cmdlets)
* Retrieve the (unsecured) device information
* Retrieve (and cache for reuse) the security port for authenticated https communication with the fritz box
* Ask for the user credentials and cache the credentials for reuse
* Retrieve the phone book
* Retrieve the call list
* Retrieve the online statistics total numbers as well as the single values of the last 20 secoonds in the past

This repo might be an interesting read for anybody on the same powershell journey and if you want to know more aboout I figured out what to call and how, please feel free to contact me.

## Precondition: Accept the Fritz Box Self Signed Certificates

SSL communication with the fritz box over the secure port uses a self signed certificate. This certificate is rejected by the .Net frameworks WebClient class by default. To overcome this restriction the fritz module registers on loading its own certificate validation strategy wich always returns $true;

```
class TrustAllCertsPolicy : ICertificatePolicy {
    [bool] CheckValidationResult([ServicePoint] $srvPoint, [X509Certificate] $certificate, [WebRequest] $request, [int] $certificateProblem) {
        return $true
    }
}

[ServicePointManager]::CertificatePolicy = [TrustAllCertsPolicy]::new()
```

If you are sensitive with your SSL security in powershell you should not use a powershell process running fritz for any other purpose.
